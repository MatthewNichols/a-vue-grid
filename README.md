# A Vue 3 data table/grid

Prototyping a Vue 3 data table with the features I need and being very careful of what dependencies I take on. I have no idea how far this will go, and it is only aimed at my project needs, but if you find it interesting enjoy. It is based on the ViteJS app template.

## Setup
- npm install
- npm run dev
